# Parsnip & Pear

## Application Overview

Unlike men, women have an infradian, or monthly hormone cycle.  The problem is, most people know nothing about that cycle and all the amazing things it can tell women about their overall health. The way we live and fuel our bodies has a huge impact on how that hormone cycle runs. Nutrient deficiencies, lack of sleep, and stress can very easily interfere with hormones functioning optimally. This app provides resources to help women educate themselves about their bodies and helps them to live and eat more cyclically for hormonal health.

I built this application in two weeks using React Hooks and CSS for styling. My goals were to incorporate full CRUD functionality with many-to-many relationships, gain a deeper understanding of React Hooks, props, and state, while also creating an approachable user experience that provides a supportive educational environment for women looking to learn more about their bodies and live a more cyclical lifestyle.  

## Features
• Users can learn about each phase of the menstraul cycle, with additon resources for exploration. 
• Users can explore a wide variety of recipes based on nutrient needs for each phase.
• Users can favorite recipes that they want to save for later access. 
• Users can add to ingredients to and edit their shopping list.
• Admin users can create new recipes.

## Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, GitHub, JSON Server, Visual Studio Code

## Wireframe

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
