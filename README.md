## Application Overview

Unlike men, women have an infradian, or monthly hormone cycle.  The problem is, most people know nothing about that cycle and all the amazing things it can tell women about their overall health. The way we live and fuel our bodies has a huge impact on how that hormone cycle runs. Nutrient deficiencies, lack of sleep, and stress can very easily interfere with hormones functioning optimally. This app provides resources to help women educate themselves about their bodies and helps them to live and eat more cyclically for hormonal health.

I built this application in two weeks using React Hooks and CSS for styling. My goals were to incorporate full CRUD functionality with many-to-many relationships, gain a deeper understanding of React Hooks, props, and state, while also creating an approachable user experience that provides a supportive educational environment for women looking to learn more about their bodies and live a more cyclical lifestyle.  

## Features
• Users can learn about each phase of the menstraul cycle, with additon resources for exploration. 
• Users can explore a wide variety of recipes based on nutrient needs for each phase.
• Users can favorite recipes that they want to save for later access. 
• Users can add to ingredients to and edit their shopping list.
• Admin users can create new recipes.
